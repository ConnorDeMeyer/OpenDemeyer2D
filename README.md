# OpenDemeyer2D
This will be an other engine that we will have to complete for the Programming 4 course in DAE. This will use the SDL framework which uses OpenGL. This means that any platform will be able to run the engine unlike my other Engine. It will also use the Entity Component System that Unity uses which is great for visually making games.
